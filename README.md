# Full Stack Developer Coding Test
## Task Management System with Team Collaboration

**Time Allocation:** 5-7 days (part-time after work + weekends)
**Tech Stack:** Next.js, Tailwind CSS, PostgreSQL, Prisma

**Important:** This is a test of problem-solving ability and ingenuity, not memorization. You are **strongly encouraged** to use all available resources including AI assistants (ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot), documentation, Stack Overflow, tutorials, and any other tools that help you build the best solution possible.

## Demo Login

For quick testing, you can use the following dummy credentials:

**Admin User**
- Email: `admin@gmail.com`
- Password: `123456`


## Development Approach

**We value resourcefulness over rote memorization.** This test evaluates:
- Your ability to learn and adapt quickly
- Problem-solving and debugging skills
- How well you leverage available tools and resources
- Code quality and architectural decisions
- Implementation efficiency and creativity

**Resources You Should Use:**
- ü§ñ **AI Assistants** (ChatGPT, Claude, GitHub Copilot, etc.) - Use them liberally!
- üìö **Official Documentation** (Next.js, Prisma, Tailwind docs)
- üåê **Community Resources** (Stack Overflow, GitHub, dev blogs)
- üé• **Tutorials and Guides** (YouTube, dev courses, articles)
- üí¨ **Developer Communities** (Discord, Reddit, forums)

**The goal is to deliver the best possible solution using whatever tools help you succeed.**

## Project Overview

Build a **Task Management System** where users can create, manage, and collaborate on tasks within teams. This project tests core full-stack development skills while being achievable within the time constraint.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Authentication & User Management
- User registration and login (email/password)
- JWT-based authentication
- Basic profile management (name, email, avatar upload optional)

### 2. Database Schema Design (Prisma)
Design and implement the following entities:
- **Users** (id, email, name, password_hash, created_at)
- **Teams** (id, name, description, created_at, owner_id)
- **TeamMembers** (team_id, user_id, role, joined_at)
- **Tasks** (id, title, description, status, priority, due_date, assigned_to, team_id, created_by, created_at, updated_at)

### 3. Core Features
#### Team Management
- Create and manage teams
- Invite users to teams (simple email-based invite)
- View team members and their roles

#### Task Management
- Create, edit, and delete tasks
- Assign tasks to team members
- Set task priority (Low, Medium, High) and status (Todo, In Progress, Done)
- Set due dates
- View tasks in different formats (list view, board view like Kanban)

#### Dashboard
- Personal dashboard showing assigned tasks
- Team overview with task statistics
- Recent activity feed

### 4. API Implementation
- RESTful API endpoints using Next.js API routes
- Proper error handling and validation
- Authentication middleware
- Database operations using Prisma

### 5. Frontend (Next.js + Tailwind)
- Responsive design that works on desktop and mobile
- Clean, intuitive UI using Tailwind CSS
- Client-side routing and state management
- Form validation and loading states
- Real-time updates (optional: use polling or WebSocket)

## Technical Requirements

### Must Have
1. **Next.js 14+** with App Router
2. **Tailwind CSS** for styling
3. **PostgreSQL** database
4. **Prisma** ORM with migrations

6. Environment variable configuration
7. Basic error handling and validation
8. Responsive design

### Bonus Points (Choose 2-3)
1. **Unit Tests** using Jest/Vitest + React Testing Library
2. **Docker** setup (Dockerfile + docker-compose for app and database)
3. **Advanced UI/UX** 
   - Dark/light mode toggle
   - Drag-and-drop for Kanban board
   - Smooth animations and transitions
   - Toast notifications
4. **Additional Features**
   - Task comments/activity log
   - File attachments
   - Email notifications
   - Search and filtering
5. **Performance Optimization**
   - Image optimization
   - Caching strategies
   - Database query optimization
